The frontend for it i used -> 

 1 --> react-vite using typeScript (-- Note -- TypeScript is new programming lang for me i learn and use it throw this App).

 2 --> zustand, for state management.


 3 --> socket.io-client, communication between a frontend and a backend for Real-time app.

 4 --> tailwind the hand for every thing in frontend.


Thank you mr/ms.
